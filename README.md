# 📊 Product Analyst Portfolio — Jamie Christian

Welcome to my **end-to-end Product Analytics portfolio**, showcasing real-world analytical workflows using **SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI**.  
This portfolio demonstrates how I approach problems the way analysts do in industry: from **data → analysis → insights → decisions**.

Each project is designed to reflect how analytics teams actually operate inside product, growth, strategy, and business organizations.
