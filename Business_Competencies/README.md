# 💼 Business & Analytics Competencies (Demonstrated in Projects)

This document contains **concrete, project-backed evidence** of competencies demonstrated across the portfolio.  
These are not claims — each bullet maps directly to real files, models, queries, and dashboards inside the project folders.

## 📈 Budgeting & Forecasting

**Demonstrated in:**
- `04_conversion_retention_revenue_kpis/excel/Channel_ROI_Budget_Model.xlsx`
- `01_ecommerce_funnel_optimization/excel/Ecommerce_Funnel_Model.xlsx`

**Evidence:**
- Built a **Budget vs Outcome model** where channel spend and attributed revenue can be edited to test scenarios.
- Implemented **best/base/worst-case logic** using editable assumption cells (blue input cells in Excel).
- Forecasted revenue impact using:
  - Funnel progression (Viewed → Cart → Checkout → Purchase)
  - AOV-based revenue modeling
- Created formulas such as:
  - ROI = (Revenue − Spend) / Spend
  - Revenue = Conversions × AOV
- Model dynamically updates outputs when assumptions change (true planning behavior).

**Business use case simulated:**
> A growth or finance team deciding how to allocate budget across channels to maximize ROI.

## 💰 Financial Modeling

**Demonstrated in:**
- `01_ecommerce_funnel_optimization/excel/Ecommerce_Funnel_Model.xlsx`
- `04_conversion_retention_revenue_kpis/excel/Channel_ROI_Budget_Model.xlsx`
- Python + SQL logic across all projects

**Evidence:**
- Built **assumption-driven models** (not static tables):
  - Editable drivers
  - Formula-based KPIs
  - Structured model layout (inputs → logic → outputs)
- Modeled unit economics concepts:
  - Conversion rate impact on revenue
  - ROI by channel
  - Revenue per event
- Structured models to resemble real-world formats:
  - Inputs section
  - KPI Scorecard
  - Decision-support outputs

**Business use case simulated:**
> Analysts supporting leadership decisions with financial logic, not just charts.

## 📊 Performance Analysis

**Demonstrated in every project folder.**

**Concrete examples:**
- Funnel drop-off diagnostics  
  → `01_ecommerce_funnel_optimization/`
- Engagement and product behavior analysis  
  → `02_streamflow_saas_product_analytics/`
- Journey complexity and conversion effort  
  → `03_user_journey_first_purchase/`
- Channel efficiency and KPI performance  
  → `04_conversion_retention_revenue_kpis/`

**Evidence includes:**
- SQL queries calculating metrics (conversion rates, counts, aggregations)
- Python scripts validating KPIs with pandas
- Dashboards visualizing trends, drop-offs, and comparisons
- Excel models translating performance into business meaning

**Business use case simulated:**
> PMs, Growth teams, and Execs asking “What’s working? What’s broken? What should we change?”

## 🤝 Strategic Business Partnering

**Demonstrated through project framing and recommendations.**

Each project README includes:
- Clear business problem definition  
- Business questions (not just technical tasks)  
- Interpreted insights (not raw metrics)  
- Actionable recommendations  

Examples:
- Funnel project suggests **where to focus optimization efforts**
- ROI project recommends **which channels to scale, optimize, or reduce**
- Journey project highlights **which users take longer and why**
- SaaS analytics project identifies **engagement and monetization signals**

**Business use case simulated:**
> Acting as the analyst who explains results to stakeholders and influences decisions.

## 🚀 Strategic Initiatives

**Demonstrated through prioritization logic across projects.**

Examples of initiative-level thinking shown in the portfolio:
- Identifying the **highest-impact funnel stage** instead of optimizing everything equally
- Recommending **budget reallocation toward higher ROI channels**
- Highlighting **behavior patterns that could influence roadmap priorities**
- Connecting analysis to potential experiments (e.g., improve checkout UX, improve onboarding, reduce friction)

This shows the ability to:
- Move beyond reporting  
- Identify opportunities  
- Support planning and prioritization  
- Think like a business partner, not a technician

## Simulated Data Disclosure

This project uses **simulated datasets** designed to reflect realistic business behavior.
The purpose is to demonstrate:
- Real-world analytical workflows  
- KPI logic and metric framing  
- Modeling, forecasting, and decision support  
- SQL, Python, and Excel techniques used in professional environments  

All analysis, structure, and methodology mirror how real analytics work is performed in industry.
