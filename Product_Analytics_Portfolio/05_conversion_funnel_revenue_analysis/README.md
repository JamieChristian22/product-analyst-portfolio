## Analytical Focus Areas

### 1. Revenue vs Time-to-Purchase
- Weekly analysis comparing revenue trends against average time to purchase.
- Identified periods where longer purchase times correlated with reduced revenue efficiency.

### 2. Device Performance
- Desktop generates highest revenue volume.
- Mobile shows strong revenue but longer time-to-purchase.
- Tablet lowest revenue, suggesting limited optimization priority.

### 3. Channel (Medium) Insights
- Organic and Referral channels generate strongest revenue.
- CPC shows faster purchase times but weaker total revenue, suggesting potential for optimization.

### 4. Geographic Performance
- United States contributes highest revenue overall.
- International markets (UK, India, Canada) show strong engagement with potential expansion opportunity.
